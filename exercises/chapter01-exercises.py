# chapter 1
# why should you learn to write programs?

# secondary memory - stores information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle

# program - set of instructions that specifies a computation

# compiler - translates a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution
# interpreter - executes a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time

# machine code - python source file

# primt 'Hello world!' - invalid syntax, print misspelled

# x = 123 - variable stored in main memory

x = 43
x = x + 1
print(x) # 44

# central processing unit - brain
# main memory - short-term memory
# secondary memory - long-term memory
# input device - headphones
# output device - microphone

# syntax error - fix grammar thru reading, running, ruminating & retreating
